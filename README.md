Output Bundles comply with the requirements of the English Courts, and are also useful for a range of other applications. 

# Usage and installation

This is configured for self-hosting, which is what these isntructions are for.


```bash
# 1. Create the virtual environment (a hidden folder named .venv)
python3 -m venv .venv

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Copy fonts to fonts directory

Buntool uses the font Charter, a popular style of font for legal documents. The four `.ttf` files need to be added to ReportLab's fonts folder:

```bash
# This command copies the fonts into your virtual environment.
# The python* wildcard makes it work for any version of Python 3.
# cp static/Charter*.ttf .venv/lib/python*/site-packages/reportlab/fonts/
```

## Ready to bake

Now you can start the server:
```bash
python app.py
```
